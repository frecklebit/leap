Orchestra Platform
==============

Provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build. Orchestra Platform is what Bonfire is for CodeIgniter.

## What Makes Orchestra Platform Different?

* **Laravel Framework** is simply a great framework to work with.
* **Extensions** are a much needed improvement to bundle implementation in Laravel. With one click activation and upgrade (migration and publish).
* **Database Based Configuration** for any extensions are a solid replacement of file based configuration, stop telling your non-technical client to edit PHP file for any simple configuration changes. 
* **Resources** lets you build HMVC implementation on top of Orchestra Platform. Hook your backend application to Orchestra with just simple API. 
* **ACL and User Management** are repetitive modules, lets stop reinventing the wheel and let Orchestra do its magic. If you need something more advanced, there are more than 20 events that you can hook into your own implementation without overwriting Orchestra core file.
* **Responsive Design** is always available when you're on mobile.
